Business / Social Impact:
 </br>There are literally many people who are striving for guidance and help at many points of time in life. This is a great area to start business and offer help for social welfare as well. And coming to social impact – what we sow, is what we reap. Helping people in case of their low points will build a strong society that will in turn build a great economy and foundation for new technological era.
 </br>This business can be scalable in future as well due to it’s broader scope and impact.
 </br>If further invested and developed new features this can be a real revolution in this digital era.
 </br>And if properly implemented, this idea can even provide people with business employment and can even attract stocks which can in turn feed the economy.
 </br>By good guidance and support for people, they can in turn help to build strong society and future
 </br>Due to inter process communication limitations these days due to social insecurities, my idea can be a barrier breakthrough for people to overcome their problems
 </br>People will suggest/recommend others with similar concerns and thus help our business and society as a whole
 </br>We can even conduct personalized 1-1 calls if possible by hiring therapists or career guiders.
 </br>We can collaborate with organizations and people like hospitals, therapists, family counsellors, life coaches, psychiatrists and skills developing institutions to improve our career guidance and other mental health related issues
 </br>We can provide a world class AI driven centers where people can interact with guiding robots with the same modelling of chatbot
 </br>We can even take a further step and set up screens and devices in restaurants, saloons, excitement parks etc... where people can interact with chatbot while doing their work.
 </br>We can even introduce this features in hospitals & educational institutes where we can get our targeted users in digital boards/ tablets.
 </br>And we can deploy an app or website for free in case of public welfare or we can even monetize by giving pro features
 </br> </br>
